This project is a comprehensive data analysis effort focused on understanding and identifying the root causes of employee turnover (attrition) within an organization. The core objective is to examine a large dataset, which includes detailed demographic information, job tenure, department, and documented reasons for leaving, to discover statistically significant patterns and connections between these variables and employee departures. By using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation studies, the project ultimately aims to generate clear, data-backed insights and actionable recommendations that management can use to develop effective strategies for improving employee retention and reducing attrition rates.
